TAXES PROBLEM 
Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with noâ€¨exemptions. 
When I purchase items I receive a receipt that lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales tax paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05 amount of sales tax. For a quantity greater than one, apply the rounding to the line item total. In other words, for a quantity q, round the result of qnp/100 to the nearest 0.05.
